                Vanessa Zúñiga Tinizaray, known professionally as "Amuki" (meaning "inner silence"), is an Ecuadorian
                designer specializing in experimental typography, pattern fonts, and kinetic typography. Her work is
                deeply rooted in the semiotic research and morphological exploration of visual symbols from Latin
                America's indigenous cultures. Through her design practice, she aims to disseminate ancestral knowledge,
                offering visual reinterpretations that bridge the past and future, fostering a continuous evolution of
                cultural expression.
                <br><br>
                Over nearly two decades, Zúñiga has developed the "Visual Chronicles of the Abya Yala," a research
                project dedicated to revaluing and globally amplifying Latin American cultural heritage. Her
                achievements include being a finalist and receiving awards at the Ibero-American Design Biennial, with
                her experimental typefaces selected for the Bienal Tipos Latinos. Her book has earned a Certificate of
                Typographic Excellence from the Type Directors Club. She has also delivered talks and workshops across
                Latin America, the United States, and France, emphasizing the importance of research in the creative
                process.
                <br><br>
                Zúñiga's work has been featured in institutions like the Letterform Archive and publications such as
                Femme Type and Communication Arts. Notably, her kinetic typography collaboration with Argentina's
                Sudtipos foundry for the "Fixture" typeface promotion received a Certificate of Typographic Excellence
                from the Type Directors Club in 2019.
                <br><br>
                Through her studio, Amuki, Zúñiga continues to explore and teach the rich visual languages of Latin
                America's indigenous cultures, fostering a deeper appreciation and pride in this heritage without
                prejudice.
