                The chant of "Azadi!"—Urdu for "Freedom!"—is the slogan of the freedom struggle in Kashmir against what
                Kashmiris see as the Indian Occupation. Ironically, it also became the chant of millions on the streets
                of India against the project of Hindu Nationalism.
                <br><br>
                Even as Arundhati Roy began to ask what lay between these two calls for Freedom—a chasm or a bridge?—the
                streets fell silent. Not only in India, but all over the world. The coronavirus brought with it another,
                more terrible understanding of Azadi, making a nonsense of international borders, incarcerating whole
                populations, and bringing the modern world to a halt like nothing else ever could.
                <br><br>
                In this series of electrifying essays, Arundhati Roy challenges us to reflect on the meaning of freedom
                in a world of growing authoritarianism.
                <br><br>
                The essays include meditations on language, public as well as private, and on the role of fiction and
                alternative imaginations in these disturbing times.
                <br><br>
                The pandemic, she says, is a portal between one world and another. For all the illness and devastation
                it has left in its wake, it is an invitation to the human race, an opportunity, to imagine another
                world.

        <p> Annotations from the book
            <br><br>
            ...a novel gives a writer the freedom to be as
            complicated as she wants—to move through worlds, languages, and time,
            through societies, communities, and politics. A novel can be endlessly
            complicated, layered, but that is not the same as being loose, baggy, or
            random. A novel, to me, is freedom with responsibility. Real, unfettered
            azadi—freedom.
            <br><br>
            ...language is
            that most private and yet most public of things.
            <br><br>
            India as a country, a nation-state, was a British idea.
            So, the idea of English is as good or as bad as the idea of India itself.
            Writing or speaking in English is not a tribute to the British Empire, as the
            British imperial historian had tried to suggest; it is a practical solution to the
            circumstances created by it.
            <br><br>
            As things stand, English, although it is spoken by a small minority (which
            still numbers in the tens of millions), is the language of mobility, of
            opportunity, of the courts, of the national press, the legal fraternity, of
            science, engineering, and international communication. It is the language of
            privilege and exclusion. It is also the language of emancipation, the
            language in which privilege has been eloquently denounced.
            <br><br>
            All this is to say that we in India live and work (and write) in a
            complicated land, in which nothing is or ever will be settled. Especially not
            the question of language. Languages.
            <br><br>
            ..is a novel written in English but imagined in several
            languages.</p>
