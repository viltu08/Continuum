                Aesthetic Journalism: How to Inform Without Informing by Alfredo Cramerotti explores the intersection of
                art and journalism, examining how contemporary art practices adopt journalistic techniques to
                investigate, represent, and critique reality. The book argues that by merging artistic approaches with
                journalistic intent, creators can challenge traditional notions of truth, objectivity, and the role of
                media in shaping public discourse.
                <br><br>
                Cramerotti outlines how artists use documentary styles, investigative methods, and narrative strategies
                to create works that question the boundaries between fact and fiction. The book highlights the potential
                for "aesthetic journalism" to engage audiences in critical thinking, fostering deeper understanding and
                reflection on socio-political issues.
                <br><br>
                With examples from visual art, photography, and new media, Aesthetic Journalism serves as a resource for
                artists, journalists, and scholars interested in the evolving relationship between information and
                representation in a visually-driven culture. This thought-provoking work is a call to rethink how
                stories are told and truths are constructed in the 21st century.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p> I was introduced to this book my Marisa Mazria Katz and it helped me understand the ethics of journalism. I
            designed cover art and infographics for an article for 'The Nation' magazine's website and this book
            acted as a guide to design for a journlastic piece written by someone other than me.</p>
