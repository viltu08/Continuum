                James C. Scott's Seeing Like a State examines how modern states make societies legible by revealing the
                processes that underpin large-scale social engineering efforts. The book dissects state-driven
                simplifications—such as standardized measurements, cadastral mapping, and centralized planning—and
                critiques their transformation of complex social realities into rigid frameworks designed for control
                and governance.
                <br><br>
                By exposing these processes as integral to the state's operation, Scott demonstrates how this
                mechanistic approach often leads to unintended and harmful consequences, such as ecological collapse or
                social upheaval. His analysis centers on the contrast between the state's imposed legibility and the
                rich, contextual, and often invisible local knowledge (mētis) that these processes erase.
                <br><br>
                Scott's work itself embodies process-as-output by methodically tracing the failures of high-modernist
                projects—from Soviet collectivization to urban planning experiments like Brasília—and making visible the
                mechanisms that produced them. In doing so, it not only critiques the outcomes of these efforts but also
                lays bare the processes behind their design and execution.
