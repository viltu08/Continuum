                Trolley Times is a newsletter brought out by like minded people – writers, artists, activists in support
                of the Kisan Morcha. It is not the official mouthpiece of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha.
                <br><br>
                Over 95,000 trollies are lined up in the crack of winter at Delhi borders, protesting over the farm
                bills. In this newsletter, we are trying to bring out protesters’ stories to them while they are camped
                out at Delhi borders. Our intent, without malice and an ulterior motive, is to simply represent peoples’
                voices. In order to do so, we are reaching out to different writers and artists to seek their
                contributions. We are aware that partisan publishing representation can create rifts in the movement.
                Our team works round the clock to choose write ups that look beyond such differences and commit to the
                progress of current movement that is exemplary because of the unity of farmers, labourers and other
                sections.The newsletter is made to clarify the real news in the midst of fake news, printed in Punjabi
                and Hindi, this four-page humble beginning is written with hope and optimism. On the first page we will
                have briefs on the direction and the state of the morcha. Rest of the pages will contain writings,
                pictures and artworks by contributors.
                <br><br>
                Trolley Times is inspired by the historic mobilisation and able leadership of all the farmers and
                farmworker organizations. The morcha has provided vigour to the farmers and farmworkers of not only the
                Punjab-Haryana region but all over India. On the one hand, the organizations have empowered and
                organized people to create the mass politicalawakening, on the other hand, the leaders of the
                organizations have pressurised the ruling and opposition political parties to speak the language of
                people’s welfare. It has brought hope to well wishers of solidarities and welfarist policies all over
                the world. The organizations’ leadership has worked resolutely to tread the ideological differences
                between themselves and bring this united movement to a point where its ultimate conclusion is victory.

        <p> Trolley Times is one of my source design objects for content for the newspaper I designed called "Visual
            Resistance", which combines El Lissitzky's essay 'Topography of Typography' with protest visuals from India.
