                Evan M. Cohen's sequential layouts are a hallmark of his storytelling, blending the visual language of
                comic art with poetic rhythm. His panels flow seamlessly, guiding the viewer's eye through narratives
                that unfold with a meditative pace. Cohen uses layout to evoke emotions, often incorporating negative
                space, shifting perspectives, and symbolic transitions that mirror the emotional and thematic
                progression of the story.
                <br><br>
                The sequential design in his work isn’t bound by conventional comic grid structures. Instead, Cohen
                often uses fluid, organic compositions where panels merge into one another, creating a sense of
                continuity and movement. This approach allows for a dynamic interplay between moments of stillness and
                action, amplifying the impact of key visual and narrative beats.
                <br><br>
                His layouts emphasize the connection between characters and their environments, often weaving elements
                of nature and the cosmos into the storytelling. This creates a sense of unity between the physical and
                emotional realms, making the sequential flow feel as intuitive as it is immersive.
