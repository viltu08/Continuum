                Moire Mag is a handcrafted, experimental webzine exploring the intersections between visual design,
                content, and interaction. After holding open submissions for the zine’s content, I designed and
                conceptualized the visual and interactive elements of each selected contribution, constructing a unique
                webpage around every piece. Each page is intended as a different experience relating to the process of
                reading. The visual/ interaction design plays with the ways we perceive and interact with content, both
                consciously and unconsciously, on the internet: it highlights and obfuscates, organizes and
                disorganizes, adds and removes to challenge or ease our understanding of the way content is communicated
                and displayed online. As any web user is aware, there’s so much untapped potential for displaying
                content on the web, so many unexplored approaches that are limited by reliance on content management
                systems. Moire Mag aims to provide a more immersive and evocative approach to displaying content online,
                while never compromising the most crucial aspect of the magazine reading experience: the coherency and
                essential meaning of the content itself.

        <p> This experimentatal website was a good resource to image how web interactions could work poetically. A part
            of my first thesis studio project, 'Monsoon Memories' is based on a similar concept.
