                    The Creative Independent (TCI) is a growing resource of emotional and practical guidance for
                    creative people, published ad-free by Kickstarter, a public-benefit corporation. We produce
                    interviews, wisdom, and guides that illuminate the trials and tribulations of living a creative
                    life, as told by working artists—including writers, musicians, designers, visual artists, and
                    others. Our goal is to feed and grow the community of people who create.
                    <br><br>
                    Each week we publish interviews, tips, essays, or how-to guides featuring a different type of
                    working artist’s wisdom. Conversations tend to focus on themes like dealing with creative anxiety,
                    starting something new, creating your own opportunities, and making time for creative work. Our Tips
                    and Guides share practical advice for how to make new things and live a fulfilling, productive, and
                    healthy life. We also occasionally publish essays, reports, and zines—all of which are intended to
                    help illuminate what it takes to survive and thrive as a creative person today.
